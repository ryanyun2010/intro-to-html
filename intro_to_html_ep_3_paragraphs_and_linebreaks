Paragraphs
==========
Paragraphs are written like this:
<p>(text)</p>
Line breaks
===========
In Html if you hit <enter> and type more you would think it would put a line break But in html you have to tell it by typing <br>
Also if you type multiple spaces that are not separeated by another letter only the first one will be displayed.
